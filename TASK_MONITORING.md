# Task Monitoring System Documentation

## Bug Fix #52: Teste Worker Individual - Monitoramento de Task

This document describes the implementation of the individual worker task monitoring system that fixes issue #52.

## Overview

The bug "[BUG] Teste Worker Individual - Monitoramento de Task" referred to the lack of proper monitoring capabilities for individual worker processes in the RPN Calculator web application. The system now provides comprehensive task tracking and monitoring.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Task Identification and Tracking
- **Unique Task IDs**: Each calculation request receives a UUID for tracking
- **User Association**: Tasks are associated with authenticated users
- **Expression Logging**: Full expression and verbose mode tracking

### 2. Process Lifecycle Monitoring
- **Status Tracking**: Tasks progress through states: `pending` ‚Üí `running` ‚Üí `completed`/`failed`
- **Process ID Monitoring**: Each worker process PID is tracked
- **Timing Measurement**: Accurate duration measurement for performance monitoring
- **Error Capture**: Complete error handling and logging

### 3. API Endpoints for Monitoring

#### Task Management
- `POST /api/calculate` - Execute calculation with monitoring
- `POST /api/test/worker` - Test individual worker functionality

#### Monitoring APIs
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all user tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/:taskId` - Get specific task details
- `GET /api/tasks/status/:status` - Get tasks by status
- `GET /api/monitor/stats` - Get task statistics

### 4. Web Interface Enhancements
- **Task Monitor Button**: Access to real-time task monitoring
- **Test Worker Button**: Individual worker testing capability
- **Task Statistics Dashboard**: Visual statistics and metrics
- **Task History**: Complete history of user tasks with status

## Implementation Details

### Task Object Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",                    // Unique task identifier
  expression: "3 4 +",           // RPN expression
  verbose: false,                // Verbose mode flag
  userId: "user-id",             // Associated user
  status: "completed",           // Current status
  createdAt: Date,               // Task creation time
  startedAt: Date,               // Execution start time
  completedAt: Date,             // Execution completion time
  result: "output",              // Calculation result
  error: null,                   // Error message if failed
  processId: 1234,               // Worker process PID
  duration: 125                  // Execution duration in ms
}
```

### Status Lifecycle
1. **pending**: Task created, awaiting execution
2. **running**: Worker process started, calculation in progress
3. **completed**: Calculation finished successfully
4. **failed**: Calculation failed with error

### Monitoring Features
- **Task History Management**: Automatic cleanup of old tasks (max 100)
- **Statistics Calculation**: Real-time statistics including success rates
- **Process Monitoring**: Individual process tracking with PIDs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Duration tracking and average calculation times

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive testing via `test_worker_monitoring.js`:

```bash
node test_worker_monitoring.js
```

Test coverage includes:
- Task creation and lifecycle monitoring
- Process ID tracking
- Duration measurement
- Error handling
- Statistics calculation
- History management

## Benefits

1. **Individual Worker Visibility**: Each calculation can be tracked individually
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Execution times and success rates are measured
3. **Error Diagnosis**: Failed tasks include detailed error information
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Process IDs allow system-level monitoring
5. **User Isolation**: Tasks are isolated per user for security
6. **Historical Analysis**: Task history enables usage pattern analysis

## Configuration

The monitoring system is automatically enabled and requires no additional configuration. It respects the existing Auth0 authentication system and maintains user data isolation.

## Logging

The system provides comprehensive console logging:
- Task creation: `üìù Task created: {taskId}`
- Task execution: `üöÄ Task {taskId} started with PID: {pid}`
- Task completion: `‚úÖ Task {taskId} completed successfully in {duration}ms`
- Task failure: `‚ùå Task {taskId} failed: {error}`
- Cleanup: `üóëÔ∏è Cleaned up old task: {taskId}`

## Security Considerations

- All monitoring APIs require authentication
- Tasks are isolated per user
- No sensitive data is exposed in task tracking
- Process monitoring doesn't expose system information

This implementation fully addresses the requirements in bug #52 by providing comprehensive individual worker task monitoring capabilities.
